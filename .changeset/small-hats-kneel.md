Remove the rrweb-all.js, rrweb-record.js, and rrweb-replay.js files from `rrweb` package. Now you can use `@rrweb/all`, `@rrweb/record`, and `@rrweb/replay` packages instead. Check out the README of each package for more information or check out [PR #1033](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1033) to see the changes.
