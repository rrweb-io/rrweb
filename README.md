# The PostHog fork of RRWeb

We're using this fork

- to make it easier to test new versions of rrweb in production at PostHog
- because patching rrweb has a poor DevEx compared to Pull Requests on this repo

We're publishing it to NPM because transparency and being open is one of our core principles

# BUT PLEASE DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS FORK YOURSELF

we'll change it based on PostHog's needs and will only be mindful of breaking changes to PostHog's usage of this published version.

You should depend on th upstream rrweb, we won't support anyone else's use of this fork.

# The upstream repo

We're still committed to supporting upstream rrweb financially and with fixes/improvements that we make at PostHog
