- [#1497](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1497) [`2606a2a`](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/commit/2606a2a28f2a6d897b8ae4ea3ec40ef0eeacbfaf) Thanks [@Juice10](https://github.com/Juice10)! - Important: If you don't reference distributed files directly, for example you run `import rrweb from 'rrweb'` you won't notice a difference. If you include rrweb in a script tag and referred to a `.js` file, you'll now have to update that path to include a `.umd.cjs` file. Distributed files have new paths, filenames and extensions. All packages now no longer include a `.js` files, instead they include `.cjs`, `.umd.cjs` and `.mjs` files. The `.umd.cjs` files are CommonJS modules that bundle all files together to make it easy to ship one file to browser environments. The `.mjs` files are ES modules that can be used in modern browsers, node.js and bundlers that support ES modules. The `.cjs` files are CommonJS modules that can be used in older Node.js environments.
